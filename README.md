# Recipes site

This project hopes to entice people with an interest in food to indulge in some recipes that are some of my favourites.

If they have an interest in Italian, French or Asian dishes they should find something of interest here.

## Recipes

In this section, there are a list of receipes that, when clickable, are directed in to the individual recipe page which details a list of ingrediatent and instructions for use.

## Testing

I tested in different browers and all seems ok on visual inspection.

I have tested locally and all seems to work on different browsers and screen sizes.

I tried to test locally prior to push to Github pages but it didn't allow the localhost url to preview in the screens (<https://ui.dev/amiresponsive>)

## Codeanywhere - Editor used to make updates and push to Github - instructions on how to use

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Codeanywhere, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Codeanywhere with no-cache, you can use this alias for `python3 -m http.server`.
